# Summary

This is a Pi1541-II Case for the Backoffice Show PCB for the Pi1541 software created by Stephen White.

This design is still a work in progress and various tweaks may still be required

Screws are required, self tappers 3mm

__v1.1__
Update to the bottom sections of the case, they needed to be taller and a pillar was slightly in the wrong place for the HDMI port to be accessed.

* case-bottom.stl
* case-middle.stl
* full-case-bottom.stl
* full-case-bottom-with-oled-screw.stl


__v1.2__
Update to full case top sections, i could not quite fit my OLED screen and board.

* full-case-top-face-large-oled.stl
* full-case-top-face-small-oled.stl


__v1.3__
Adjustment for tolerances for OLED screens.

* full-case-top-face-large-oled.stl
* full-case-top-face-small-oled.stl
* case-face-large-oled.stl
* case-face-small-oled.stl

__v1.4__

Removed the separate parts as it is easier to print just the top with front already attached.
Moved front posts further back to give more room.

__v1.4.1__

Moved the Pi closer to the edge, removed the large oled version because after testing it wasn't correct and needs a redesign i think. May be screen on one side buttons on the other. Also attached is the sketch up file (with current large oled), this file is a bit messy and i think for v1.5 or v2.0 i may start again.

__v1.5.1__

Completely redesigned the case.

The pi1541-front.stl only requires support, others do not.

The old V1.4.1 is still available in zip

M2 screws are used to join Mid and Bottom together.

M3 screws are used to join Top to the base.
